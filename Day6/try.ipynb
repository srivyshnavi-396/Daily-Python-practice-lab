    "'''1. The try Block\n",
    "Definition: The try block is a container for code that has the potential to raise an error. It does not handle errors; it simply monitors them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logic: As soon as a line in the try block fails, Python stops executing the rest of the try block and jumps immediately to the except block.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax: try:\n",
    "           #code\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The except Block\n",
    "Definition: This is the \"Handler.\" It defines the logic that should run if a specific exception occurs. It prevents the program from terminating.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logic: You can have multiple except blocks for different types of errors (e.g., one for FileNotFoundError and one for PermissionError).\n",

    "Syntax: except:\n",
    "             #code\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The else Block\n",
    "Definition: The else block contains code that should execute only if no exceptions were raised in the try block.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logic: This is useful for code that should only run if the \"risky\" operation was successful. It helps keep the try block clean by separating the risky code from the \"success\" code.\n",

    "Syntax: else:\n",
    "           #code\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The finally Block\n",
    "Definition: The finally block is the \"Clean-up\" block. It executes regardless of whether an exception occurred or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logic: Even if your program crashes or uses a return statement, the finally block will still run. It is essential for releasing external resources like database connections or network sockets.\n",

    "Definition: The raise keyword is used to manually trigger an exception when a specific condition (defined by the programmer) is met.\n",
